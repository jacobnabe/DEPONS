Linking DEPONS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on DEPONS. 
Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of DEPONS give you permission to combine DEPONS 
with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the 
standard release of Repast Simphony under the Repast Suite License (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license). 
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for DEPONS and the licenses of the 
other code concerned.

Note that people who make modified versions of DEPONS are not obligated to grant this special exception for 
their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. 
The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; 
this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
