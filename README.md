# DEPONS
Simulating effects of disturbances on harbour porpoises in the North
Sea.

This is the third public version of the DEPONS model for simulating
population effects of noise for the harbour porpoise. Version 3.0 differs
from version 2.3 in making it possible to simulate the population impact
of noise from ships, where sound emission from ships is related to the
speed, length and type of the ships. Ship movements are defined by the
user (potentially based on AIS data). Sound transmission loss is related
to bathymetry and sediment type. Harbour porpoise fine scale
movements are calibrated based on animals tagged in the North Sea,
and their deterrence behaviour is related to both distance to ships and
received sound levels, as observed for tagged animals (see TRACE
document for details).

The objective of the DEPONS model is to simulate how harbour
porpoise population dynamics are affected by disturbances, and was
first developed to simulate effects of pile-driving noise associated with
construction of offshore wind farms. Now it facilitates studies of
cumulative impacts of pile-driving noise and ship noise. The animals’
survival is directly related to their energy levels, and the population
dynamics are affected by noise through its impact on the animals’
foraging behaviour. By ensuring that the animals’ movement patterns,
space use and reactions to noise are realistic, the population dynamics
in the model have the same causal drivers in the model as in nature.

The model was developed as part of the DEPONS project (Disturbance
Effects of POrpoises in the North Sea) at Aarhus University, Denmark.
The extension that enabled simulations of responses to ships was part
of the SATURN project (EU Horizon 2020; GA 101006443 ). The code
was developed in Eclipse/Repast, and must be installed under this
framework. See http://www.depons.dk or contact Jacob Nabe-Nielsen
